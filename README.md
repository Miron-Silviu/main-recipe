## My process

In the first instance I installed tailwind using CLI and then I added assets and created index.html, style.css and input.css. The project was build with mobile first in mind and after that moved to desktop layout .

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
 -tailwind

## What I learned

I learned how to use table in tailwind, how to implement flexbox and how to add different types of font from input.css.
